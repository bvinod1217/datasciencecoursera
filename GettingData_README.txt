This output includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.


- ‘data.txt’: Training and Test data combined into single data set. Note features are on a standardized scale and have no units.

- ‘means.txt’: Average of all features in above data set across individuals and activities.

- run_analysis.R: Script file that takes in raw data from the study described below and calculates the data set means.txt. Requires the dplyr package. To run this script need all training and test files from the study below as well as activity labels and features.

Steps are as follows:

1) load dependencies and appropriate files
2) clean training and test files, combining y labels, activity labels, and predictors
3) subset training and test predictors to only mean and sd ones
4) combine training and test sets
5) calculate average of features across individuals and activities
6) clean up data for export and save as txt file

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
